                    I am a programming student who is currently pursuing his degree in university but computer science was never my only passion rather just one of them. My other passions include architecture, music production, photography, film production and so much more. I started Compile Projects in 2020 as both an area where I can freely solidify my ideas for programs which I've made as well as with the goal of revolutionizing the way in which the distribution of application impacts people's lives.

                    <p class="about_us_desc_mini">
                        When I first learned to program I was astounded at all of the amazing capability that could be achieved through this tool. Instantly, I was filled with many ideas about applications and programs that I could write to solve many problems. This perfectly fell in alignment with my own personal characteristics as I realised through programming I can create happiness for myself and others as well as create good in this world.

                    <p class="about_us_desc_mini">
                        Throughout my life before learning programming I was frequently frustrated at the lack of free tools available to the average consumer. I often found myself unable to complete basic tasks without having to pay subscriptions or one time fees which I couldn't afford or encounter steep learning curves to accomplish simple tasks. We set-out to change this through empowering people with robust free web applications.

                        Throughout my life I have witnessed countless business owners operate their firms in a manner that mistreats their employees. This problem is one which not only i have personally encountered but also my friends and family. However, at Compile Projects itâ€™s about being different to these people. Every employee, customer and stranger are treated as equal because this is what we believe in. No person is above another.

                    <p class="about_us_desc_mini">
                        Giving back is something which has always mattered dearly to me as an individual, as well as through our business. Unfortunately, to be able to give back financially wealth must be generated. However, this does not stop us from giving back in our own ways. We try to offer the lowest rates we can and offer giveaways as frequently as possible. This is so that we can help out as many people as possible because for us it is not solely about the product but rather its impact.
